# Bikesharing

## Analysis Overview

This project consisted of an analysis of data from the New York City bike-share service. With the information obtained, Tableau visualizations were created and presented to an investor to analyze the possibilities of how a bike-share business would work in De Moines, Iowa.

## Results

### General Overview of citibike trips

When reviewing the information on the trips made by people using the bicycle service in the city of New York, we can observe the following. Of the 2,344,224 trips that were made, 443,865 of the people who used the bicycles are customers, that is, they are not subscribers to the service. On the other hand, 1,900,359 of the users are subscribers to the citibike service. 

On the other hand, of these trips, information shows that 1,530,272 of them were made by men, while 588,431 were made by women. 225, 521 trips were not recorded for either gender.

### August Peak Hours

In the second graph regarding the August Peak Hours we can see that the hours when people use the service the most are from 8:00 to 9:00 am, followed by 5:00 pm, 6:00 pm and 7:00 pm. Particularly, the hours that most people use the bicycles are 5:00 pm. 
This information may reflect the fact that the service is mostly used during the hours when people come in and out of work. This would indicate that it is mainly used as a means of transportation for daily activities. 

### Checkout Times for Users

The following graph shows the relationship between the number of bicycles according to the minutes or hours being used. We can see that 146, 752 bicycles were used for 5 minutes. With this information we can conclude that the trips registered in the database were mostly short trips of 5 minutes. 

### Checkout Times by Gender

Similarly, the following graph shows the relationship between the number of bicycles according to the minutes or hours of use by gender. In the graph we can see that men are the ones who use the most bicycles, and specifically that 108, 087 of those trips were of 5 minutes. Women, on the other hand, registered 34, 151 trips of 6 minutes. 

### Trips by Weekday per Hour

The following graph shows the relationship of the number of trips according to the day of the week and time of day. We can see that the highest number of trips were registered on Thursday at 6:00 p.m. with 44,905.
From Monday to Friday from 5 to 7 p.m. is when we can observe the highest number of bicycle trips. Sundays and Saturdays from 6 to 8 a.m. are the hours with the least number of trips registered. 

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

Likewise, the following graph shows the analysis of trips by day and time of day of the week by gender. We can observe that women use the citibike service mostly on Thursdays at 6:00 p.m., 11,336 trips are registered. On the other hand, men register a greater number of trips throughout the week, mainly from Monday to Friday from 7 to 9 in the morning and from 4 to 7 in the afternoon. As for women, Thursdays at 6:00 p.m. register the highest activity with 30,749 trips. 

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

The last graph shows the relationship between the use of the citibike service per day according to usertype and gender. We can see that male subscribers are the ones who use the bicycles more on Thursday. The graph registers 259, 316 trips in this category. On the other hand, another important observation is that within the category unknown in gender we can identify that the highest number of trips that are recorded are on Saturday and that they are customers. This could indicate that it is families who use the service on Saturdays, without the need to register within a gender or to contract the service as frequent subscribers could be generating more trips during the weekends. 

## Summary
In conclusion, we can see that the citibike service is convenient for people who use bicycles as a means of transportation during the week. Specifically among men and women who work during working hours from 6 to 7 o'clock in the day. On the other hand, families who use the bicycles on weekends for recreational purposes could also be a source of service utilization. The largest number of trips registered in the NYC citibike database are subscribers, indicating that people do hire the service for long-term purposes. 

This information can give the team seeking to establish the service in De Moines a clear idea of what people would use the citibike service for. Campaigns can be conducted to get people to commute to work by bicycle or to encourage people to explore the city on weekends by bicycle. It would be important to consider whether the city has the best conditions on public roads for bicycle travel, or whether there is sufficient social awareness among people about bicycle traffic.

For future analysis it would be important to obtain the following information and visualizations:
- The age ranges of the users who use the service.
- The distances traveled on the trips. 
- The main reasons for using the service.
